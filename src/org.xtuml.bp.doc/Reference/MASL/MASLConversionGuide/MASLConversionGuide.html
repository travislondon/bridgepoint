<h1 id="masl-modeling-and-conversion-guide">MASL Modeling and Conversion Guide</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>BridgePoint xtUML is designed to support the executable, translatable UML (xtUML) approach<br />
to the Shlaer-Mellor methodology for Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). However, xtUML is not<br />
the only language to have its roots in this MDA approach. MASL is another dialect that has<br />
evolved from the Shlaer-Mellor methodology and developed a community of users. Now this common<br />
ancestry offers modelers in either community the potential to move models between the two<br />
dialects. BridgePoint xtUML is an editing and execution platform for xtUML modelers. With the<br />
addition of conversion tools, extensions to import/export facilities and a MASL-aware editor,<br />
BridgePoint xtUML is a powerful platform for MASL modelers to advance their work and employ<br />
MASL downstream tools. When moving MASL models into xtUML, an idiom must be followed. This<br />
document details that idiom and the extensions to the platform that make working with MASL<br />
inside BridgePoint xtUML possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-masl---xtuml-modeling-idiom">The MASL - xtUML Modeling Idiom</h2>
<p>To ensure that MASL models with its usage of bridging components are accurately represented<br />
in xtUML, a set of recommendations and restrictions must be followed. Collectively these form<br />
the MASL-xtUML idiom and are the foundation for model representation and error-free MASL export<br />
with BridgePoint xtUML.</p>
<p>Since MASL and xtUML are based on the Shlaer-­Mellor Method, the two languages are similar at the<br />
core. Consequently, most mappings between constructs in the two languages are straight­forward<br />
(e.g., MASL Object maps to xtUML Class) and are therefore not detailed here. However, each<br />
language has been extended differently leading to some mappings that are less obvious, and these<br />
are explained in the sections below.</p>
<p>The idiom addresses three areas of concern: bridge technologies between domains, model packaging<br />
to maintain visibility, and Type mapping. By following the practices outlined in the MASL-xtUML<br />
idiom, models that start as MASL can be converted to xtUML, modified inside the xtUML Editor and<br />
exported back as MASL for processing by downstream tools.</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-masl-bridging-flexibility-inside-xtuml">Maintaining MASL Bridging Flexibility Inside xtUML</h3>
<p>Systems are typically constructed by connecting multiple MASL domains or xtUML components using<br />
some form of bridging technology. Where MASL employs terminators and public services, xtUML uses<br />
interfaces consisting of interface operations/signals and ports. The basic mappings between MASL<br />
and xtUML are simple: a service declared on a terminator corresponds to an interface operation on<br />
a port while a public service surfaced by a MASL domain is rendered as a function invoked by a<br />
port activity.</p>
<p>However, MASL bridging provides flexibility in the way MASL domains can communicate. For example,<br />
a MASL domain may use a subset of the services surfaced by another MASL domain, and it may choose<br />
to refer to those services by names different than the MASL domain providing them. Also, a forking<br />
bridge allows a MASL domain to view as a single service two or more services provided by any number<br />
of MASL domains.</p>
<p>Since xtUML provides bridging based on a single definition for each interface, it is necessary to<br />
introduce a bridging component into the MASL system that replicates MASL’s flexibility. The idiom<br />
illustrated below offers the same level of domain isolation in xtUML that the MASL approach affords.</p>
<p><img src="images/image04.png" alt="MASL Idiom Example" /><br />
<strong>Figure 1</strong></p>
<p>In Figure 1, magenta rectangles are references to reusable domain components while the green rectangle<br />
is a project component that implements the project­-specific bridge requirements.</p>
<p>Each component representing a MASL domain sprouts a single provided interface containing an interface<br />
operation for each public service surfaced by the MASL domain as declared in the MASL domain interface<br />
file. This provided interface covers all incoming interface operations for the domain component, and<br />
the complementary interface is always located on the project component.</p>
<p>A special naming convention must be followed when creating a MASL Project component (in Figure 1 the<br />
green component) from scratch. After the provided interface is formalized, the port must be renamed<br />
from its default name (e.g. &quot;Port1&quot;) to <code>&lt;domain&gt;__&lt;terminator&gt;</code> with the double-underscore<br />
separating the domain and terminator names.</p>
<h3 id="deferred-operations">Deferred Operations</h3>
<p>To create a deferred operation, create an operation with an identical signature in each subtype<br />
class. Then use the Properties view to set the dialect of the supertype class' operation to<br />
&quot;None&quot;. Each subtype class' operation dialect is set to &quot;MASL&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="masl-projects">MASL projects</h3>
<p>There are some situations when the editor must distinguish between a MASL<br />
domain and MASL project. Because domains are where the majority of the work<br />
will take place, no special annotation is needed. For MASL projects however,<br />
the description field of the package that contains a project component must<br />
contain the string &quot;masl_project&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="xtuml-model-packaging-for-system-wide-masl-visibility">xtUML Model Packaging for System-wide MASL Visibility</h2>
<p>Under xtUML, model elements defined within one component have no knowledge or visibility of model<br />
elements (including types) defined within another component. This is different from MASL where public<br />
types defined within a MASL domain can be accessed by other MASL domains using a qualified name of the<br />
form: <code>otherDomainName::someType</code>. Consequently, upon conversion to xtUML, if each MASL domain<br />
is packaged within a component, this access is lost, and types defined within that MASL domain become<br />
invisible to other components of the system. Consequently, provisions in the organization of the<br />
model are needed to maintain system-wide visibility. Accordingly, all shared types, including those<br />
used on terminator services, must be packaged outside domain components. Similar visibility restrictions<br />
exist for xtUML interface definitions, and the solution is for all xtUML interface definitions exposed<br />
by the domain component to be packaged outside the domain component representing the MASL domain.</p>
<p>To address these differences in scoping of types and interface definitions, the following packaging<br />
conventions are recommended. Each MASL domain converted to an xtUML model contains a single top-level<br />
domain package which then contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single domain component definition representing the MASL domain<br />
</li>
<li>all shared types and all interface definitions associated with the MASL domain</li>
</ul>
<p>To support system-side visibility, BridgePoint’s support for inter-project references (IPR) is<br />
leveraged. The xtUML Project in a workspace that is a MASL Project will enable IPRs and thus will gain<br />
access to the components and types shared by other (MASL Domain) projects in the workspace.</p>
<p><img src="images/image03.png" alt="MASL Project Layout" /><br />
<strong>Figure 3</strong></p>
<p>A typical xtUML project using this approach is illustrated in Figure 3. Note that all shared types<br />
defined in the MASL domain are contained within the Shared package associated with that MASL domain,<br />
and these type definitions are not included in the component representing the MASL domain. With<br />
BridgePoint xtUML, the conversion facility produces a single xtUML model file adhering to the<br />
packaging and naming scheme illustrated. Modelers are free to repackage and rename their models as<br />
they see fit, so long as these two conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>all elements shared among components are defined outside the components that refer to them<br />
</li>
<li>all elements associated with a MASL domain reside within the domain package for that MASL domain</li>
</ul>
<p>For xtUML models, packaged in this way, the export facility produces a MASL domain interface file (<code>.int</code>)<br />
that includes the shared types residing in the package associated with the MASL Domain.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-xtuml-and-masl-types-separate">Keeping xtUML and MASL Types Separate</h3>
<p>The MASL type system does not align perfectly with that of xtUML. So during import, no MASL types<br />
are mapped to xtUML types, and the entire MASL type system is adopted into the xtUML Editor. While<br />
editing the model, the MASL activities can be freely edited and parameters and attributes can be<br />
typed with MASL types.</p>
<h4 id="type-reference">Type Reference</h4>
<p>In xtUML typing is established through a link between the model element being typed and a particular<br />
instance of a type. However, MASL treats a type reference as a first ­class concept which makes typing<br />
a model element in MASL slightly more complex than it is with xtUML. This is because a type reference<br />
in MASL can further constrain the type that is applied to the affected model element. Since variable<br />
declarations exist only within activities expressed in MASL, these references do not receive special<br />
handling and are kept with the MASL code block.</p>
<p>To access shared types from other domains in MASL action language, the modeler must copy the <code>&lt;other domain&gt;.int</code><br />
file into the local project's <code>models/</code> folder.</p>
<p>To access shared types from the structural part of the model, the modeler must create a type reference<br />
in the local domain. This is done by creating a new UDT in the current domain with a special name that<br />
references the domain where the type actually lives (e.g. <code>OtherDom::someType</code>).</p>
<h2 id="bridgepoint-extensions-for-masl">BridgePoint Extensions for MASL</h2>
<p>The MASL extensions added to BridgePoint xtUML involve adding MASL conversion tools, extending<br />
the BridgePoint Import/Export facilities and adding a MASL-aware Editor. Each of these enhanced<br />
facilities are described in the sections below.</p>
<h3 id="masl-model-conversion">MASL Model Conversion</h3>
<p>The conversion of MASL domains and MASL projects into MASL-infused xtUML models is performed<br />
by the tool <code>masl2xtuml</code> and is invoked from the command line. The conversion command<br />
<code>masl2xtuml</code> has the following syntax for MASL domains:</p>
<p><code>masl2xtuml -d &lt;directory path&gt; -o &lt;directory path&gt;</code></p>
<p>and for MASL projects</p>
<p><code>masl2xtuml -p &lt;directory path&gt; -o &lt;directory path&gt;</code></p>
<p>where <code>&lt;directory path&gt;</code> is any relative or absolute directory path, <code>-d</code> identifies<br />
the MASL domain, <code>-p</code> identifies the MASL project directory and <code>-o</code> identifies the<br />
destination directory where the xtUML model file is written to. A complete reference is<br />
included in the MASL documentation.</p>
<p>The MASL domains and MASL projects are processed one at a time in any order. All conversion<br />
can be performed sequentially or each conversion can be followed by a BridgePoint model import.<br />
However, the conversion is incomplete until all MASL domains and at least one MASL project<br />
have been successfully processed.</p>
<p>Note that MASL models can be converted and imported in any order. However, before importing an<br />
xtUML model representing a MASL project, all domains referenced by that project must first be<br />
imported.</p>
<h4 id="xtuml-model-packaging-for-preserving-masl-activity-blocks">xtUML Model Packaging for Preserving MASL Activity Blocks</h4>
<p>During the conversion from MASL to xtUML, each MASL domain is mapped to a domain component, and<br />
each project is converted into a project package. Within a MASL domain, activity can be<br />
associated with public services and terminators at the interface, and data processing within<br />
the domain through operations, functions, and state machine actions. Once converted these MASL<br />
action code blocks are kept with the associated xtUML model element, but in separate storage.</p>
<h3 id="masl-import-extension">MASL Import Extension</h3>
<p>To translate a MASL model into an xtUML model inside BridgePoint involves two steps: a<br />
conversion step and an xtUML import step. The conversion step was discussed in a previous<br />
section and involves the tool <code>masl2xtuml</code>. The output from this conversion tool is a<br />
MASL-infused xtUML model file that can be imported into an existing xtUML project using<br />
the BridgePoint import facility. BridgePoint xtUML import can be achieved interactively<br />
through the xtUML modeling perspective (see below).</p>
<p>The xtUML import step is a procedure covering three steps: create the xtUML project, enable<br />
the use of Inter-Project References (IPRs), and finally use xtUML model import to bring<br />
the <code>masl2xtuml</code> created MASL-infused xtUML model file into the xtuml project. Each of<br />
these steps must be repeated for each MASL domain and MASL project.</p>
<p>It is important to recall that the MASL-xtUML idiom requires system-wide scope for some model<br />
elements and this is facilitated in BridgePoint using Inter-Project References. For IPRs to<br />
automatically connect referenced model elements during import, these referenced elements must<br />
already be in the workspace. Consequently, the project package must only be imported after all<br />
referenced domain packages have been imported. This is the only import order dependency created<br />
by the idiom, and all MASL domain packages can be loaded in arbitrary order.</p>
<h4 id="bridgepoint-model-import-from-the-xtuml-modeling-perspective">BridgePoint Model Import from the xtUML Modeling Perspective</h4>
<p>As described earlier, the MASL-xtUML idiom organizes the BridgePoint workspace based on projects,<br />
and an xtUML project is needed for each converted domain and project. To perform each import from<br />
inside BridgePoint, the xtUML modeling perspective is used following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an xtUML project using <strong>File &gt; New &gt; xtUML Project</strong>. This command will ask for a name<br />
which must be unique among all projects in the workspace. A descriptive name that includes a<br />
connection to the original MASL domain or MASL project is suggested.</li>
<li>Enable the IPR preference for the created project using the steps described below.</li>
<li>Select <strong>File &gt; Import</strong> to start a model import. This will open the Import model wizard.</li>
<li>Expand the xtUML folder and select xtUML Model from the list of import sources.</li>
<li>After <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> ing on Next, enter the full path to the MASL-infused xtUML model file<br />
to be imported. Pressing the Browse button will open a file browser where <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> s are<br />
used to navigate through the folder list down to the file to be imported.</li>
<li>Once the path is entered, <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> Finish to initiate the import.</li>
<li>Upon completion, the Model Explorer view will be updated.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="masl-export-extension">MASL Export Extension</h3>
<p>The conversion of xtUML models to MASL is a single step operation that is invoked from either<br />
the xtUML Editor perspective or a command line. The MASL Export extension consists of the<br />
<code>xtuml2masl</code> conversion tool and enhancements to the BridgePoint Export facility to support<br />
the MASL Export Domain or MASL Export Project flows.</p>
<h4 id="masl-export-from-the-xtuml-modeling-perspective">MASL Export from the xtUML Modeling Perspective</h4>
<p>The steps to export an xtUML model to MASL from BridgePoint start with the Model Explorer view.<br />
Here the source xtUML project is selected by clicking on the package containing the project to<br />
be exported as either a MASL domain or MASL project.</p>
<p>The conversion is activated by selecting <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Export MASL domains</strong> for a domain project<br />
or <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Export MASL project</strong> for a MASL project. During the export process, progress is<br />
reported in the Console view, and if errors occur an error log will appear at completion of<br />
the operation.</p>
<h4 id="masl-export-from-the-command-line">MASL Export from the Command line</h4>
<p>To export xtUML models to MASL equivalent models without invoking the BridgePoint UI, the<br />
<code>xtuml2masl</code> tool is used. This tool makes use of the environment variable <code>WORKSPACE</code><br />
which must be set to the directory path of the xtUML workspace holding the source xtUML project.<br />
It is recommended that all xtUML projects be contained in a single workspace, however this is<br />
not enforced by the export tool. If the complete xtUML model is contained across multiple<br />
BridgePoint workspaces then the <code>WORKSPACE</code> variable must be modified between <code>xtuml2masl</code><br />
invocations.</p>
<p>To invoke the MASL export tool, the following syntax is used</p>
<pre><code>xtuml2masl  -i &lt;eclipse project path&gt; -d &lt;package name&gt; [-o &lt;output directory&gt; ]  |  
-i &lt;eclispe project path&gt; -p &lt;package name&gt; [-o &lt;output directory&gt; ]</code></pre>
<p>See the <code>xtuml2masl</code> reference page in BridgePoint Help for complete details. Note, if<br />
the <code>-o</code> parameter is omitted, the current directory is used by default.</p>
<h3 id="masl-editor-extensions">MASL Editor Extensions</h3>
<p>Once a MASL model has been imported as an xtUML project, BridgePoint extensions for MASL<br />
are accessed through the xtUML Editor perspective. These extensions to the perspective<br />
enable MASL-aware code editing and MASL export.</p>
<h4 id="the-xtuml-editor-perspective">The xtUML Editor Perspective</h4>
<p>When working with xtUML and MASL inside BridgePoint, the xtUML Editor perspective is used<br />
exclusively. This perspective consists of four primary views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Explorer provides easy navigation of the model.<br />
</li>
<li>Graphical Editor for editing component, class and state machine diagrams. Each diagram<br />
type provides a palette of drag and drop diagram elements.<br />
</li>
<li>Console displays error and information messages when models are built.<br />
</li>
<li>Properties provides access to the list of properties associated with a model element.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these views is documented in the BridgePoint Help facility which can be accessed<br />
through <strong>Help &gt; Help Contents</strong>.</p>
<p>A popular addition to the default xtUML Editor perspective is the Navigator view which provides<br />
easy navigation of the files and directories contained within an xtUML project. This view can<br />
be added from within BridgePoint by selecting <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Navigator</strong>.</p>
<p>Each model element has an Editor that can be opened in a number of ways, and since the xtUML<br />
Modeling perspective is model-aware, can be opened from within Editors and views. The most<br />
common view for navigating and opening model elements is the Model Explorer view. In this view,<br />
model elements can be opened for editing by select the model element and either <strong>&lt;double-click&gt;</strong> it<br />
or using <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Open With</strong> to choose an Editor. Once activated, a new tab will appear in the<br />
canvas area and the contents of the model element presented inside the Editor.</p>
<h4 id="the-masl-editor">The MASL Editor</h4>
<p>Inside a MASL-infused xtUML model, there can be both MASL and OAL activities. To best support<br />
MASL, the extensions to BridgePoint xtUML include a full featured text editor with MASL syntax<br />
highlighting.</p>
<p>The editor will appear when a model element containing MASL is <strong>&lt;dbl-click&gt;</strong> or when using<br />
<strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Open MASL</strong>. In the Navigator view, selecting a <code>.masl</code> file and <strong>&lt;dbl-click&gt;</strong> will<br />
open the MASL editor as well.</p>
<h4 id="when-an-action-contains-both-oal-and-masl">When an Action contains both OAL and MASL</h4>
<p>Initially, models developed in MASL are unlikely to contain OAL. However, as the model matures<br />
inside BridgePoint, it is possible that new model content will be a mixture of MASL and OAL with<br />
some model elements containing both. To Edit these MASL-infused components, select the model<br />
element from within Model Explorer, and use <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Open With</strong> to choose either the OAL or MASL<br />
editor options.</p>
<p><img src="images/image02.png" alt="xtUML Preferences" /><br />
<strong>Figure 4</strong></p>
<p>An alternative means is to set a default choice using the Default Action Language preferences (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).<br />
The preference is located under <strong>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; xtUML</strong>, and after selecting the button next to<br />
desired editor, <strong>&lt;click&gt; OK</strong> to close the window.</p>
<h4 id="inter-project-references-and-masl">Inter-Project References and MASL</h4>
<p>The MASL-xtUML idiom uses Inter-Project References (IPRs) to provide system-wide scope to some<br />
model elements. IPRs are a mechanism for xtUML model elements defined in one xtUML project to<br />
be used in another xtUML project. For the access to be allowed the referring project must have<br />
IPRs enabled.</p>
<p>To check if IPRs are enabled for a particular xtUML project, select that project in the Model<br />
Explorer View and then select <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Project Preferences</strong>. This will open a popup window (Figure 5),<br />
and selecting Inter-Project References will show the setting Allow inter-project model references.<br />
The use of IPRs is enabled if the checkbox is marked. For the models based on the MASL-xtUML idiom,<br />
all xtUML projects containing a MASL Domain component must have this checkbox unmarked and those xtUML<br />
projects containing a MASL Project must have this checkbox marked. For these xtUML/MASL Projects,<br />
the preference must be set prior to importing the file created by masl2xtuml.</p>
<p><img src="images/image01.png" alt="xtUML Project Preferences" /><br />
<strong>Figure 5</strong></p>
<p>TODO<br />
When a domain component, shared data type or shared interface is modified, all projects referencing<br />
that model element will be marked with a warning icon on all affected model elements. There are<br />
two approaches to resolving these warnings. For projects where the modeler is not the owner of<br />
the referenced model element then the update must be done using the following steps to pull the<br />
changes into the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the project folder in the Model Explorer view.<br />
</li>
<li>Synchronize the changes by selecting <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Synchronize with Library</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In cases where the modeler is owner of both the referenced and the referring projects then the<br />
update can be globally pushed from the referenced project to the referring projects using the<br />
following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the project folder in the Model Explorer view.<br />
</li>
<li>Synchronize the changes by selecting <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Synchronize references</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="appendix-a.-the-gps-watch-example">Appendix A. the GPS Watch Example</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the MASL extensions of BridgePoint xtUML, the GPS Watch example (Figure 6) will<br />
be used. This model represents an exercise watch that records location, heart rate, and elapsed<br />
time as the wearer performs a physical activity. The model is composed of four components: a<br />
heart rate monitor, a location component, a tracking component and a user interface.</p>

<li>To launch BridgePoint xtUML, execute the ```<BridgePoint Home>/bridgepoint```` and during the startup<br />
of BridgePoint xtUML a workspace selection pop up window will appear.</li>
<li>In this window, either type the path to the desired workspace directory or <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> on Browse and<br />
navigate to this folder.</li>
<li>Once entered, <strong>&lt;click&gt; OK</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>BridgePoint will then open on the Welcome page. To open the xtUML Modeling perspective <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> on<br />
the workbench icon. The Model Explorer View should be empty at this point.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-xtuml-projects">Create xtUML projects</h3>
<p>Having produced the individual xtUML projects, they are ready to be assembled into an xtUML<br />
model inside BridgePoint xtUML. The model structure described in an earlier section is used<br />
here and implemented using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an empty xtUML project using <strong>File &gt; New &gt; xtUML Project</strong> and give it the name<br />
HeartRateMonitor. <strong>&lt;click&gt; Next</strong>. On the model compiler selection page choose “C Model<br />
Compiler (Source)”. <strong>&lt;click&gt; Finish</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Import the converted xtUML model using <strong>File &gt; Import</strong> and select xtUML Model under the xtUML<br />
folder. Once selected, <strong>&lt;click&gt; Next</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Browse to the folder <code>~/Tutorial/xtUMLprj/HeartRateMonitor</code> and check mark HeartRateMonitor<br />
for the destination.<br />
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 Through 3 for Location, Tracking and UI models.<br />
</li>
<li>The final step is to import the top level project GPSWatch, Again create an empty xtUML project<br />
using <strong>File &gt; New &gt; xtUML Project</strong>, give it the name GPSWatch. Select the GPSWatch project in the<br />
Model Explorer view, then<br />
<strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Project Preferences</strong>. This will popup the Project Preferences window and after selecting<br />
Inter-project References should confirm that the preference Allow inter-project model references<br />
is checked. If not, <strong>&lt;click&gt;</strong> on the box and a checkmark will appear.<br />
</li>
<li>Import the converted MASL project found in <code>~/Tutorial/xtUMLprj/GPSWatch</code> into the GPSWatch<br />
xtUML project.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="navigating-through-the-xtuml-model">Navigating through the xtUML model</h3>
<p>With the model now populated inside the workspace, the various views and editors of BridgePoint<br />
can be used to visualize, modify and export the model. Navigating around the model can be<br />
performed from inside either the Model Explorer or Navigator views. Each view employs a tree<br />
representation of the model and individual model elements can be located using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand the tree from the project folder down through the model packages by clicking the triangle<br />
next to the right of the package or model element symbol.<br />
</li>
<li>Repeat a until the desired element is revealed in the tree.<br />
</li>
<li>To open the model element in a BridgePoint editor, hover over element and then <strong>&lt;dbl-click&gt;</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Diagram editors and MASL activity editors are both accessible from Model Explorer. For MASL<br />
activity blocks, the Navigator view can be used to launch the editor using a similar sequence<br />
of steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>By expanding the tree from the project folder down through the model packages and model elements</li>
<li>Repeat until the desired <code>.masl</code> file is revealed in the tree.</li>
<li>To open the file in a BridgePoint MASL editor, hover over filename and then <strong>&lt;dbl-click&gt;</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="modify-masl">Modify MASL</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, when a model contains MASL-infused xtUML model elements, the <strong>&lt;dbl-click&gt;</strong><br />
behavior is based on the default action language preference selection and the given dialect for an<br />
activity.</p>
<p>In the tutorial model, the Tracking domain contains MASL-infused model elements and MASL code<br />
will be added to the stopped state within the WorkoutTimer state machine. The steps to make<br />
this change are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inside Model Explorer, expand the tree from the Tracking project folder down through the<br />
tracking packages and WorkoutTimer class to the stopped state of the Instance State Machine<br />
</li>
<li>To open a new MASL activity and associate it with the stopped state, hover over the stopped<br />
state inside Model Explorer. Next <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Open With &gt; MASL Editor</strong></li>
<li>In the MASL editor, add the code</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>public service WorkoutTimer::stopped (user_id : in  integer,
                                      groups  : in  sequence of string) is
                                                   
begin
         console &lt;&lt; &quot;Forced activity on workstation. &quot; &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; flush;
   
end service;    </code></pre>
<p>Save the changes and close the editor. Repeat step 3, and this time the MASL code will appear.<br />
The difference in selection is due to the presence of MASL action language and the selection of<br />
MASL for Default Editor preference.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-the-masl-infused-xtuml-model-to-masl-domains-and-masl-projects">Exporting the MASL-infused xtUML model to MASL domains and MASL projects</h3>
<p>The conversion of xtUML projects into MASL domains and MASL projects is conveniently performed<br />
from the Model Explorer view by first selecting the top package within the xtUML project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with the xtUML project HeartRateMonitor which is a domain within the GPSWatch model.<br />
</li>
<li>Once the package is selected, convert the project into a MASL domain by <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Export MASL domains</strong><br />
</li>
<li>When completed the <code>export.log</code> file will appear. Check the log for Errors or INFO<br />
messages. During MASL export, a <code>masl/</code> directory is created in the project if not present and<br />
the produced MASL files along with the export log will be stored below it. The contents of the<br />
<code>masl/</code> directory are visible in the Navigator view.<br />
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for xtUML projects UI, Location, and Tracking.</li>
<li>The final conversion is for the GPSWatch project which will be converted into a MASL project. Select<br />
the GPSWatch package and <strong>&lt;RMB&gt; &gt; Export MASL project</strong>.</li>
</ol>
