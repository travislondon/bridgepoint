<h1 id="activity-editor">Activity Editor</h1>
<p>The Activity Editor is used to edit the action language (called activities in<br />
UML 2.0) for those model elements that can define them: functions, bridge<br />
operations, instance-based and class-based operations, derived attributes, and<br />
state actions. The Activity Editor is a syntactically-aware editor that assists<br />
the user in writing the applications actions.</p>
<p><img src="activity_editor.jpg" alt="activity_editor.jpg" /></p>
<p>When an activity is written, it is checked for both syntax errors (missing<br />
semi-colons and malformed keywords) and semantic errors (references to unknown<br />
classes or events in the model). As can be seen in the figure above, the two<br />
errors result in several indicators inside the editor and entries in the<br />
Problems view.</p>
<p>The small red circle with an X in the left-hand vertical ruler points to the<br />
line that contains the error. This annotation in the editor corresponds to the<br />
error as it is listed in the Problems view. The Problems view shows a<br />
description of the error along with its location. Double-clicking on the error<br />
in the Problems view positions the cursor on the activity in the editor. If the<br />
activity is not currently being edited, the Activity Editor is brought up.</p>
<p>The right-hand vertical ruler shows an overview of the annotations for the text<br />
currently being displayed in the editor. The red ones indicate the position of<br />
errors in the activities. Clicking on the annotation positions the cursor to<br />
the activity containing the error.</p>
<p>Each of the errors is also underlined with a red squiggly line to indicate the<br />
exact position of the error on the line.</p>
<h3 id="declaration-searching">Declaration searching</h3>
<p>The Activity Editor supports searching for the declarations of certain elements<br />
referenced from the activity. To search for a declaration, right click, then<br />
select &quot;Open Declaration&quot;. For references to structural elements, the Model<br />
Explorer and Canvas views will be activated to focus on the element. For local<br />
variable references, the first usage of the variable in the editor will be<br />
highlighted. Some element types are not supported by the &quot;Open Declaration&quot;<br />
action. If this menu option is selected when the cursor is on an unsupported<br />
element, no action will be taken.</p>
<h3 id="completion-assistance">Completion assistance</h3>
<p>The Activity Editor supports smart completion assistance in many OAL constructs.<br />
To activate, type 'Ctl+Space'. Completion assistance can also be auto activated<br />
on user defined character sequences. For more information about completion<br />
assistance configuration see the <a href="../../Preferences/HTML/ContentAssist.html">Content Assist Preferences<br />
documentation</a></p>
