# Provide prototypes for specified issues
### xtUML Project Implementation Note

### 1. Abstract

This note describes the changes required to prototype each issue listed in the document references.  Where an analysis was previously performed it shall be followed.  In the case where an analysis was not performed this note may be used to aid in full analysis if required.

### 2. Document References

<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 [BridgePoint DEI #4896](https://support.onefact.net/issues/4896) Not possible to specify datatypes with the same name at different levels.
<a id="2.2"></a>2.2 [BridgePoint DEI #5005](https://support.onefact.net/issues/5005) Ranges of data types.
<a id="2.3"></a>2.3 [BridgePoint DEI #5106](https://support.onefact.net/issues/5106) Constant based on user data type.
<a id="2.4"></a>2.4 [BridgePoint DEI #9050](https://support.onefact.net/issues/9050) Element order is inconsistent between ME and canvas for constants.
<a id="2.5"></a>2.5 [BridgePoint DEI #4859](https://support.onefact.net/issues/4859) Class-based operations in a class are not clearly distinguishable from instance-based operations. They appear in the same way. In BridgePoint 6.1 they were underlined to distinguish them form instance-based operations. This is the UML standard notation.
<a id="2.3"></a>2.6 [BridgePoint DEI #5035](https://support.onefact.net/issues/5035) Open source object when clicking on imported/delegated/referenced elements (classes, signals, operations) as for component references.

### 3. Background

See issue database.

### 4. Requirements

4.1 Follow requirements of analysis where available.

### 5. Work Required

5.2 Ranges for UDTs

5.2.1 Add Range class

A new class Range is added to the Domain package under ooaofooa.  This class has a conditional one to one relationship according to the analysis note for [2.2](#2.2).

A Rance may have a minumum and maximum value.  These are added as attributes min and max.  The new attributes are set as real to handle the full minumum and maximum values.  The UI handles validation with type determination, integer versus float.

This same change is made to both ooaofooa and mcooa.

5.2.2 UI Range configuration

A new menu along with three sub menus are added.  These are:

* Range
* Range > Minimum...
* Range > Maximum...
* Range > Clear Range

The Range top level menu shows as long as the selection contians only UDTs that have a core type of integer, real or Enumeration Data Type.  The Clear Range menu item will only show as long as one of the selected User Data Types has a Range associated already.  The Range menu will not show when mixing integer or enumeration data type with real.  This is due to the fact that a real value can be invalid for an integer value.

The Minumum... and Maximum... menu items open an input dialog.  This dialog assures that the input value is valid.  In the case of integer the string value is parsed.  If a NumberFormatException is thrown a message is given indicating an invalid entry.  In the case of a float the value is parsed and the given float is checked for NaN and infinite exceptions.  The same message is given for the invalid float.

5.2.3 Add range data to compare and persistence

Three new entries are added to ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql to cover external attributes for the UDT class.  An external attribute is used to display an attribute from another class under the one associated.  In this case the min and max values from the Range class associated with the User Data Type.  This change allows the range values to show in compare.  Note like Visibilty these are not available in the properties view.  More work is required to support such a change.

The file_io.pei and stream.pei data is modified to add a new child to User Data Type, Range.

### 6. Implementation Comments

None.
