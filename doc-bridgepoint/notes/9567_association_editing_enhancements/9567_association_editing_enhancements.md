# Enhanced association editing  
### xtUML Project Analysis Note

### 1. Abstract

This note analyzes some approaches to which we could enhance association editing support in the tool.  

### 2. Document References
<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 [BridgePoint DEI #9567](https://support.onefact.net/issues/9567) Cardinality on right click menu  

### 3. Background

3.1  

Modifying association related data currently requires selecting the association, leaving the diagram editor, and navigating the properties view.  This is inconvenient and has potential of losing the selection along the way having the need to return to the diagram editor.  Along with its inconvenience it is also not as easy to understand the properties view as it is raw metamodel data.  To the user an association should be what is seen on the diagram editor:  

Class On One Side, Multiplicity, Conditionality, Text Phrase  
Class On Other Side, Multiplicity, Conditionality, Text Phrase  

### 4. Requirements

4.1 User shall be able to modify an association without the properties view  
4.1.1 User shall not have to leave the diagram editor  
4.1.2 Association data being modified shall be no more difficult to understand then as shown on the diagram  

### 5. Analysis

5.1 Modification without the properties view  
5.1.1 Modification without leaving diagram editor  
5.1.1.1 In-place editing  

Given the requirement to not leave the diagram editor in-place editing is a strong candidate.  The main benefit of in-place editing is that you are modifying the data that you are looking at.  If you understand the association, you then understand what you are modifying.  For this issue in-place editing shall be enabled for Multiplicity/Conditionality, Text Phrases and Assocation Number.  A validation of text entered for Multiplicity/Conditionality shall ensure that only the following is allowed:  

0..1  
1  
1..*  
*  

For text entered on an association number, validation must guarantee an integer.  For Text Phrase modification there shall be no validation.  An error indication shall be shown when entered values are not acceptable.  This may be a pop-up near the editing area, which does not interfere with the user modification.  It also may be error text in the Eclipse notification area near the bottom of the tool.  

Of course editing via in-place editing shall be treated just as editing is elsewhere.  Meaning changes are persisted, undoable etc,.  

5.1.1.2 Editing tab  

Another possibility which does not leave the diagram editor is to add a new Association tab to the diagram editor.  This tab shall show association data in a simple manner that does not veer far from the diagram editor.  A good example of what could be shown is in [[3.1]](#3.1).  This tab shall dynamically show when an association is selected.  The selection shall contain only one association.  Editing shall support Multiplicity, Conditionality, Text Phrase and Association Number.  The Multiplicity/Conditionality shall be modifiable via a drop down menu.  Text Phrase shall be an unverified modifiable text field.  Association Number shall require validation of an integer value and as in [[5.1.1.1]](#5.1.1.1) notification of invalid data shall be given.  

5.1.2 Context menu item to modify Multiplicity  

The original issue [[2.1]](#2.1) requests that a new menu item shall be added for adjusting Multiplicity.  This adheres to the requirements but does not fully cover modifying the association.  Such a dialog shall display two pull down menus allowing configuration of Multiplicity, with options of One or Many.  Each pull down menu shall have a label associated with the side of the associaton being modified.  In most cases this shall be the Class name at that end of the association.  In the case of a reflexive association the label shall indicate the referring Class (if formalized) by appending the Referred To Identifier Attribute text.  For example the label in a reflexive association could be: WorkoutSession {startDate, startTime}.  As with the other two approaches the change shall be handles just as any other editing action in the tool.  

5.3 Suggestions on moving forward  

[[5.1.2]](#5.1.2) seems like only a partial solution and would require the addition of two new menu items to complete Association modification.  This would be Set Text Phrases, and Set Conditionality.  

[[5.1.1.1]](#5.1.1.1) and [[5.1.1.2]](#5.1.1.2) both seem like good choices and actually could compliment each other.  Either will fulfill the requirements.  The suggestion for this analysis is to proceed with 5.1.1.2 simply because it allows one to take focus off of surrounding elements while editing the association.

### 6. Work Required

6.1 Editing tab (Deliverable One)  
6.1.1 Create a new plugin org.xtuml.bp.core.editors  
6.1.1.1 Assure that the new plugin will make contributions to the UI  
6.1.1.2 Add bp.core and bp.ui.graphics as requirements (as a minimum)  
6.1.2 Add a plug-in extension to the org.xtuml.bp.ui.graphics.editorTab extension point  
6.1.2.1 Create a new Page factory  
6.1.2.1.1 Have the page factory create and return a SWT Composite that shall be created below  
6.1.2.2 Create a new Page class which extends SWT Composite  
6.1.2.2.1 Create a new TableViewer class   
6.1.2.2.1.1 Create four columns: Class, Multiplicity, Conditionality and Text Phrase   
6.1.2.2.1.2 Set headers visible for the Table Viewer  
6.1.2.2.1.3 Create a GridLayout which splits the available space in two, vertically  
6.1.2.2.1.4 Create a new Label which will have a value of Association  
6.1.2.2.1.4.1 Create a new GridData for the Label which centers the label  
6.1.2.2.2 Create a new TableContentProvider which when given an element will provide a parent and all children of the element  
6.1.2.2.2.1 Use the HierarchyMetaData to locate the referential children of the root association for the TableViewer  
6.1.2.2.2.2 Use the HierarchyMetaData to locate each referentials children  
6.1.2.2.2.2.1 Use the referential and its children to populate the row in order  
6.1.2.2.3 Create a new TableLabelProvider  
6.1.2.2.3.1 Refactor archetype which converts hierarchy entries into UI consumable text (see model.compare)  
6.1.2.2.3.1.1 Use converted text to provide labels for all elements  
6.1.2.2.3.1.2 Use CorePlugin to determine the appropriate icons for each entry  
6.1.2.2.2.3 Always provide as the first two children the attribute hierarchy data (Numb and Descrip)  
6.1.3 Rework the editor tab support to allow existence depending on state  
6.1.3.1 Support plugin extension option for on-demand tabs  
6.1.3.1.1 Define plugin extension as on-demand based on association selection  
6.1.3.1.2 Support removal of tab when commanded to do so by extending plug-in  

6.2 Editing support in tab and refreshing (Deliverable Two)  
6.2.2 Refactor the ElementEditingSupport class from model.compare  
6.2.2.1 Move the ElementEditingSupport class and any common supporting classes to the plugin created in [[6.1.1]](#6.1.1)  
6.2.2.2 Change from using a compare transaction manager to using the standard transaction manager TransactionManager.getSingleton()  
6.2.2.3 Assure this refactored class supports model compare  
6.2.3 Add support for element editing in the TableViewer class created in [[6.1.2.2.1]](#6.1.2.2.1) Â 
6.2.3.1 Using the refactored ElementEditingSupport add support for all table cells  
6.2.3.2 Assure that only those elements editable are  
6.2.3.3 Introduce an error tool tip either refactoring what is used in model compare or creating another implementation  
6.2.3.4 Modify the ElementEditingSupport to use an editor for text phrases  
6.3 Add transaction listener to the TableViewer

### 7. Acceptance Test

7.1 Associations shall be modifiable without the properties view  
7.2 Association modification shall trigger persistence

### End
