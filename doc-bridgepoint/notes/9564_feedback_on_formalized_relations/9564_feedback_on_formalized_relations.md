# Feedback for formalized associations  
### xtUML Project Design Note

### 1. Abstract

This note describes a change that shall allow visual indication that an association is formal.

### 3. Background

Currently there is only one way to determine if an association has been formalized and that requires looking at the formalizers class attributes.  

### 4. Requirements

4.1 On the class diagram, an association that is formalized shall be visibly distinct    

### 5. Analysis

5.1 Possibilities  
5.1.1 Coloring  

We could modify the color of the association line when said association is formalized.  However, this would not be a complete solution as some people are color blind.  On top of that, one can manually color a line to match leaving a misguided understanding of the association.  

5.1.2 Text appending  

Another approach would be to modify the drawn connector text to include a list of attributes which formalize the association.  The end result would be something of this affect: R1 {identifier1_attr}.  

5.1.3 Dashed line  

We could modify the line to be dashed when the association is formalized.  We would have to make sure to use a different dash policy so that it is not confused with associative links.  

5.1.4 Append symbol to line  

A symbol could also be drawn just off of center and towards the formalizer class along the association line.  This could be a filled triangle pointing at the formalizer class for instance.  If this approach was taken we must consider the direction of the line, meaning that the arrow must rotate to match alignment.  

5.1.5 Make all formalized associations bold  

For another approach without coloring we shall consider making all formal associations bold.  This gives a clear picture of formal associations just by looking at the diagram.  Selection shall increase the thickness further indicating that the association is selected.  More indication of formalization is shown by making the association text bold as well.  

5.2 Analysis decision  

The best approach here is to bolden the association line and text.  This gives a clear picture of the formalized associations.  Thus section 5.1.5 is chosen.   

### 6. Design

6.1 Make formal associations bold  

To easily distinguish between informal and formal associations we shall take the approach of drawing formal associations as bold.

6.1.1 Introduce Style::Bold  
6.1.2 When drawing a connector if the line style is Bold, set the line width to 2  
6.1.3 In Association.get_connector_style() return Style::Bold if isFormal() is true   
6.1.4 Adjust Gr_c in ui.canvas to support the Bold style for compartment drawing  
6.1.5 Change ModelClass.get_compartment_style to return Bold for entries at the right if the attribute is referential  

### 7. Design Comments

None.

### 8. User Documentation

User documentation will be updated to account for the new highlighting features including the preference added to control the feature.

### 9. Unit Test

9.1 For each assocation type, Simple, Linked and Supertype/Subtype  
9.1.1 Call get_connector_style on a formalized association  
9.1.1.1 The Bold style is returned  
9.1.2 Call get_connector_style on a unformalized association  
9.1.2.1 The None style is returned  
9.1.3 For a simple, supertype/subtype, and linked association open a diagram with a formalized and unformalized variation  
9.1.3.1 The formalized association is drawn bold     
9.1.3.2 The unformalized association is not drawn bold Â
