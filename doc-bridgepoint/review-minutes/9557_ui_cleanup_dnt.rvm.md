-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   bob  5.1      Add a reference to the issue that did this work
x- 02  min   skb  6.2.1.2 Adjust the Developer product to include the new "parent" -> feature 
x- 03  min   skb  6.2.3      Shall be removed in code and plugin.xml
x- 04  min   skb  6.3.1      use -> user
o- 05  min   skb  6.3.1      keith notes that his experience is that editing the launch config while in eclipse cause eclipse to crash. This means to do this, user must exit eclipse. Note that Levi did this during the review and did NOT have this problem.
x- 06  min   levi  6.3.2     line break is needed on the line containing "6.3.2"
x- 07  min   bob  6.3.3.2 can be 6.3.3.1.1 changing this number makes it clear that core/plugin.xml is generated. Of course number that follows must be updated accordingly.
x- 08  min   skb  7      In the pallete there is a spelling of "Use Case" that is not consistent. A change shall be made to the context menu to make this consistent. It shall be "Use Case"
x- 09  min   skb  7       There is a case where there are identically named items in CME and pallette. A change shall be made to handle this.
x- 10  min   bob  8      This task should also consider the items we are removed to assure they are removed from docs
