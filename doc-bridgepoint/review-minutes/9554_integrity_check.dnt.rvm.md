-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01   min     5.1         skb     Add a reference to the model called out
x- 02   min     5           all     We need to get feedback from SAAB on this note. 
x- 03   min     5.3         levi    ASSOC -> ASSR   
x- 04   min     5.3.4        skb     describe more of the reasoning. Loose coupling with meta-model, 
                                    command-line use case, performance 
                                    We also discussed that in the current architecture, select FIO will only search
                                    for instance in the current model root. So, taking the approach of pasting the generated 
                                    OAL would have to consider this BP architecture.
x- 05   min     ???         skb     consider saving output to a file rather than a file so perhaps it can be marked up
x- 06   min     6.1.1       levi     consider multiple identifiers   
x- 07   min     6.1.3.1     levi     Strike the "s" from supertype(s) 
x- 08   min     7           bob     the first sentence reads "for each requirement above", 
                                    but does not specify the section. It appears this is 
                                    referring to 6.0, General Flow, so refer to that. 
x- 09   maj     6.3         cort     Cort will spell out the disposition of the current integrity 
                                    checker in combination with this new one

Major observations were recorded, a re-review is required.
